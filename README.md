Experiment name: Banker's Algorithm for Resource Allocation

Introduction:
The Banker's algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance technique used in operating systems. It ensures that processes can request resources without causing deadlock. 
In this lab report, we analyze and explain an implementation of the Banker's algorithm in C++.


Code Overview- 
Objective:
    - Simulate resource allocation and check if a given sequence of processes is safe.
    - The program takes input for allocation, maximum resource requirements, and available resources.
- Components:
    - alloc: Allocation matrix (process × resource).
    - max: Maximum matrix (process × resource).
    - avail: Available resources.
    - need: Need matrix (calculated as max - alloc).
    - f: An array to track whether a process has been allocated resources.
    - ans: An array to store the safe sequence of processes.
- Algorithm Steps:
    - Calculate the need matrix.
    - Implement the safety algorithm:
        - Check if a process can execute safely by comparing its need with available resources.
        - If safe, allocate resources and mark the process as executed.
        - Repeat until all processes are executed or a deadlock is detected.
- Output:
    - If a safe sequence exists, display it.
    - Otherwise, indicate that the given sequence is not safe.


Conclusion:
The Banker's algorithm helps prevent resource deadlocks by ensuring safe resource allocation. 
It balances resource availability and process execution.
